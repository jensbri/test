# 1. Structured manipulation 
- car body shop (very accurate, stupid/no uncertainty / variability 
- Human/animal: variability machines 
- AI good at tasks that we consider for smart people (chess,...) but bad at making a cup of coffee 
- Machine learning: image net (feed it a few 100'000 images and it learns to distinguish between a motorcycle and a car
- Training and categorize

# 2. unstructured scenarios 
(autonomous Dakar Rally)

- Reverent Bayes: Idea: combine prior beliefs about the world with evidence from unrialabe data
- Weights = post synaptic 
- Supervised learning: adapt the weights
- Probabilistic AI learing is similar to machine learning but not the same. 
- Likelihood doesn't sum up to one 
- Google Street view (scanner etc. ) is worth more than the car; Oxfort: regular DashCam

## Example of Classroom

1. multiply Belief (ex. 1/130)* Data Likelihood (90%, 70%...)
2. Rules: Rev. The. Bayes (on doctrine of chances)

Drop dots where it is likely>> more particles 
(particle filter)
Doesn't tell you were you aren't but how how uncertain you are about it 
Paul Newman (dashcsm instead of Google Streetview super expensive laser)

Dyson. Cam. Tracking of distinctive features. Saves it's battery 

Planning in uncertain worlds
- Robot: particle filter + stuff on top >> relations 
- Belief + beliefe dynamics
- Epistemical knowledge 
- Predical logic 
- Is a
- Know 
- Assume
